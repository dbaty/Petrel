Todo
====

- change implementation of content types views:

  - views should be configured one by one in a directive within
    '<content_type>';

  - templates should be specified within the view function, not the
    ZCML directive.

- use 'name' or 'id', not both

- add tests;

- implement navigation tree;

- imlement site map;

- refine CSS (footer, etc.);

- order items in folder (see recent changes in repoze.folder);

- add 'file' and 'image' content types;

- ability to select a default document in a folder

- use the catalog to list items in the folder view page (?)

- add automatic creation and modification date attributes on items

- add a tab to enter metadata in the edit form: keywords, author,
  etc.

- configure CLEditor:

  - do not show all buttons in the toolbar;

  - make the editor wider;

  - use the CSS of the site.

- implement an error page for 404 errors


Pluggability
============

- create an example application that registers new content types, use
  a different layout/CSS, etc.

- implement a mechanism that lets us have a different layout/CSS if we
  are managing content.

  1. The 'authoringmode' middleware is nice but we have to tweak each
     and every URL that is generated or, worse, stored, which include
     search results (the path is stored as a metadata). On the other
     hand, the middleware could also process HTML on egress,
     i.e. inserting the '/authoring/' prefix.

  2. A simple solution would be to set a cookie when the user wants to
     manage content. This makes it hard to provide a "preview" page,
     though.
